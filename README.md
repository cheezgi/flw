# flw

**f**ocus **l**ast **w**indow

This script came from the fact that [windowchef](https://github.com/tudurom/windowchef)
doesn't focus the last window when the current window is closed. Hacked
together with [microlight](https://github.com/stevedonovan/Microlight),
[wtf](https://github.com/wmutlis/core), and [wew](https://github.com/wmutils/opt).

flw requires wtf and wew to be installed and in `$PATH` to work. Also assumes
that `os.execute` works on your system.
